# kickstarter-analysis
# Overview of Project

# Purpose

Analyze a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends in order to provide an analysis to Louise of previous kickstarter campaigns to formulate her success.

# Analysis and Challenges


###Using the kickstarter data we were able to get a general idea of how the other 4,000 crowdfuning projects went. 
Along the way of cleaning the data, the answers  for both the sum & number of percentage successful, failed and canceled was found by creating and manipulating Pivot tables.
The outcome of how successful the theater campaigns were during their crowdfunding was also discovered on a pivot chart. 
No challenges were presented during this time. It would be wise to take your time when typing out all of this code as the simplest mistake can camoflauge itself in a lot of code.  

# Results
- Two conlusions that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 The shows seem to have done their best during warm months and begin to decline once it gets cold.

-What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

When looking at the chart you can tell that majority of all campaigns were for less than 5000. A majority of campaigns between 35000 and 45000 were successfucl.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations is that we only looked at two different datasets for each of the above analyses.
