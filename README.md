# kickstarter-analysis

#Analyze a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends.

#Overview of Project

###The purpose of this project is to view how different companies fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goal. 
In the kickstarter data sheet, we found the number and percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. 

# Analysis and Challenges

###Using the kickstarter data we were able to get a general idea of how the other 4,000 crowdfuning projects went. 
Along the way of cleaning the data, the answers  forboth the sum & number of percentage successful, failed and canceled was found by using pivotcharts.
The outcome of how successful the theater campaigns were during their crowdfunding was also discovered on a pivot chart. 
Challenges along the way came from using =COUNTIFS & VLOOKUP as the data set did not want to process the data and continued giving me an error message on my excel sheet. Both issues were overcome by beginning a new data set.
